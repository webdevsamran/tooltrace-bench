    "Optic -- repo gone (404)". Optic's repository is not gone. It is
    `opticdev/optic`, archived with 1,534 stars; this script was asking for
    `useoptic/optic`, which does not exist. A typo in a constant became a
    published claim that an archived competitor had disappeared, which is
    both wrong and the opposite of useful -- an archived incumbent in this
    exact domain is the most interesting fact in the file.
