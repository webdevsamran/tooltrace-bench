"""A badge must point at something that exists.

Badges are the first thing a reader sees and the easiest thing to leave
stale: a workflow gets renamed, a Python version is dropped, a coverage floor
moves, and the row keeps asserting the old answer. These derive every claim
from the repository itself, so the row cannot say something the repo does not.
